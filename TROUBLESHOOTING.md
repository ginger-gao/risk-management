# Troubleshooting Guide
--- test for branch riskmanagementB1
Dear Learner,

due to some npm dependency updates, you could potentially run into some issues.
The course authors already created a new version of the course, which also uses the highest CAP release then. It will be available in the upcoming weeks. In the meantime, you can do the following to get your app running:

First and foremost, make sure to check your cds version:

```bash
cds -v
```

It should print something similair like this:
```bash
@sap/cds: 6.1.3
@sap/cds-compiler: 3.1.2
@sap/cds-dk: 6.1.5
@sap/cds-dk (global): 6.1.5
@sap/cds-foss: 4.0.0
@sap/cds-mtx: -- missing --
@sap/eslint-plugin-cds: 2.5.0
...
```

If your ```@sap/cds``` dependency is lower than 5.9.x, then please make sure to upgrade your cds packages:

```bash
npm i @sap/cds-dk && npm i @sap/cds && npm update
```

Verify your cds version again with ```cds -v```.

Some learners also reported that there is currently an issue with the approuter: 

Error Message:  ```The redirect_uri has an invalid domain.```.

If you face this issue, you have to overwrite your ```mta.yaml``` file with the following content:

```NOTE: Please change the oauth2-configuration redirect-uri to your approuter's url!```

```yaml
